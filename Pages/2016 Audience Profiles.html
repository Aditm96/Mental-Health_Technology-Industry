            <p>
                The age range of the respondents in the 2016 datasets were like those in the 2014 survey. 
                That survey showed that most of the participants had a prior job, mostly in technology. It also showed the majority 
                of people involved in the survey worked within companies that were predominantly technology focused, 
                where most were either involved in the front-end or back-end stage of development. The final observation of the average 
                profile is that most of the people recieved treatment.

            <h1>Male Profile</h1>
            <p>
                The first aspect of the male participant profile is that most of them are in their thirties while also having prior
                professional experience, most of the time in technology focused companies. It also shows that most participants work in either 
                the front or back end stage of development. However, these observations are not enough to verify strategies that would enocurage 
                more male employees in the technology start up industry to seek more help, if needed.

            <h1>Female Profile</h1>
            <p>
                The first aspect of the female participant profile is that most of them are in their thirties while also having prior
                professional experience, most of the time in technology focused companies. It also shows that most participants work in either 
                the front or back end stage of development. Unlike male participants, these observations provide a potential vantage point
                into strategies that would encourage more employees in the technology start up industry to seek more help, if needed.
