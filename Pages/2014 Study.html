                <br>
                <p>Analyzing the data showed that there were a few trends found in one gender and not in the other. The data showed that companies that were more focused on technology had a significant effect on how female employees were able to complete their work, but not with the male employees. 
                    It also showed that male employees would seek more help for their concerns as the number of co-workers decreased. Here, supervisors could split tasks into smaller groups to account for mental health stress.  
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    This data provided results that would create potential solutions to improving mental health response in the technology startup industry. 
                    However, the data was collected in 2014, six years prior to this specific study. Since the data was collected at one point of time and far back, recent data would have to be collected. An additional study would be able verify the results of this current study as well as expanding upon the current conclusions. There was a 2016 survey that used similar variables and therefore is relevant to the current study. 
                    Hence, this study was used as a baseline for a future study on that dataset that is currently in the pre-production stage.
