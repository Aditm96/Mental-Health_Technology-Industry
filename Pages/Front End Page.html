                <h1>Project Overview</h1>
                <br>
                <p>Mental health is a serious issue that is often hidden to others because of the stigmatism of a perceived weakness. The tech industry is no exception. 
                    It is full off start-ups where many people attempt to prove the long-term success of their ideas within a tight deadline. 
                    This pressure has caused the rate of mental illnesses among tech professionals to be more than double the rate of current US adults, according to a recent survey done by OSMI. 
                    The following project focuses on getting help for mental health concerns in the technology start-up workplace. 
                    This study is currently done in two parts with the first part analyzing data from a 2014 survey and the next part analyzing data from a 2016 survey.  
                </p>
                <br>
                <h1>Methodology</h1>
                <br>
                <p>Both parts of the study was done in several sections. The first part was to create an audience profile of the total dataset, and then two seperate ones, one for each gender. 
                    This was done to create an baseline from which the next step, which was using model selection and logistic regression to select the most optimal factors given a specific method.  
                    Each profile was composed of the following: summary statistics for the age and distributions for the location, predominance of technology within the organization and whether they sought treatment.
                </p>
                <p>Once the profiles were created, the study employed a backwards stepwise model to select the best factors to look at for sepcifc strategies for companies that wanted to 
                    improve accesibility to mental health solutions. Once the best models were chosen, a logistic regression was done to ensure the relaibility and set up predictions, which would
                    be another test of relaibility.  
                </p>
                <br>
                <h1>2014 Results</h1>
                <p>	The analysis on both male and female datasets shows that technology companies should focus on steps that would decrease the level of interference that mental health struggles has on an employeeâ€™s daily tasks. 
                    Another area where supervisors can focus on to improve the workplace for their employees is to take steps to encourage co-workers to work with each other to resolve their issues. 
                    On the other hand, companies should ignore potential indicators such as age and amount of remote work as they were not significant in any of the eight models chosen through the analysis.
