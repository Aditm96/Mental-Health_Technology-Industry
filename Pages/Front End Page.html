                <h1>Project Overview</h1>
                <br>
                <p>Mental health is a serious issue that is often hidden to others because of the stigmatism of a perceived weakness. The tech industry is no exception. 
                    It is full off start-ups where many people attempt to prove the long-term success of their ideas within a tight deadline. 
                    This pressure has caused the rate of mental illnesses among tech professionals to be more than double the rate of current US adults, according to a recent survey done by OSMI. 
                    The following project focuses on getting help for mental health concerns in the technology start-up workplace. 
                    This study is currently done in two parts with the first part analyzing data from a 2014 survey and the next part analyzing data from a 2016 survey.  
                </p>
                <br>
                <h1>2014 Results</h1>
                <p>	The analysis on both male and female datasets shows that technology companies should focus on steps that would decrease the level of interference that mental health struggles has on an employeeâ€™s daily tasks. 
                    Another area where supervisors can focus on to improve the workplace for their employees is to take steps to encourage co-workers to work with each other to resolve their issues. 
                    On the other hand, companies should ignore potential indicators such as age and amount of remote work as they were not significant in any of the eight models chosen through the analysis.
